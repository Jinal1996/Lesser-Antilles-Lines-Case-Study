## **Highlights**

### **Key Insights**
- **Optimal Price Recommendation**:  
  - **LAL (Lesser Antilles Lines)**: $1,300  
  - **KL (Kronos Lines)**: $1,400  

- **Equilibrium Profits**:  
  - **LAL**: $895,050  
  - **KL**: $1,008,150  
  - **Total Combined Profit**: $1,903,200  

### **Important Conclusions**
- The recommended pricing strategy ensures profitability while maintaining market equilibrium.  
- The analysis demonstrates that the Nash equilibrium exists at ($1,300, $1,400), where neither LAL nor KL has an incentive to deviate unilaterally.  
- The market dynamics in the Caribbean liner industry, with its near-perfect price inelasticity, support the stability of this pricing strategy.
