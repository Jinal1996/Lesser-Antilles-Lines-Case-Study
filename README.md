## **Results**

### **Key Insights**
- **Optimal Price Recommendation**:  
  - **LAL (Lesser Antilles Lines)**: $1,300  
  - **KL (Kronos Lines)**: $1,400  

- **Equilibrium Profits**:  
  - **LAL**: $895,050  
  - **KL**: $1,008,150  
  - **Total Combined Profit**: $1,903,200

## **Important Conclusions**
- The recommended pricing strategy ensures profitability while maintaining market equilibrium.  
- The Nash equilibrium exists at ($1,300, $1,400), where neither LAL nor KL has an incentive to deviate unilaterally.  
- The near-perfect price inelasticity of the Caribbean liner industry supports the stability of this pricing strategy.
